# Release Management

This file is used to manage releases for the terraform-modules repository.

## Current Version Strategy

This repository uses **Semantic Versioning** (SemVer) with the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backwards compatible bug fixes

## Triggering Releases

### Automatic Release (Recommended)

Releases are automatically triggered when changes are detected in the `CHANGELOG.md` file under the `[Unreleased]` section during a merge to `main`.

### Manual Release

To manually trigger a release:

1. Update this file with a release note
2. Commit and push to main
3. The release workflow will automatically detect changes and create a new version

## Release Types

Set the release type by adding one of these lines to your commit message or PR description:

- `release-type: major` - For breaking changes
- `release-type: minor` - For new features (default)
- `release-type: patch` - For bug fixes

If no release type is specified, `minor` will be used as default.
