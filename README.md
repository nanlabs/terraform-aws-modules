### 📘 Example Index & Estimated Monthly Cost

| Example | Path | Core Services | Est. Monthly Cost* | When to Use |
|---------|------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 🌐 Simple Web App | `examples/simple-web-app` | VPC, EC2/ALB (or minimal compute), basic networking | ~$46 | MVPs, prototypes, hackathons |
| ⚙️ Medium Complexity | `examples/medium-complexity-infrastructure` | VPC, EKS, RDS, Bastion, basic logging | ~$300 | Growing microservices, staging clusters |
| 🏢 Complete Enterprise | `examples/complete-enterprise-setup` | Multi-AZ VPC, EKS, RDS (HA), MSK, Bastion, Transit GW, logging, encryption | ~$940 | Production-grade platforms |
| 🔐 Secure Multi-Environment Data Platform | `examples/secure-multi-environment-data-platform` | VPC, CloudTrail, Config, Data Lake, KMS, Glue | ~$420 | Regulated / compliance-focused data workloads |
| 🛰️ Hub & Spoke Networking Architecture | `examples/hub-and-spoke-networking-architecture` | Central VPC + spoke VPCs, Transit Gateway | ~$160 | Multi-team / multi-VPC segmentation |
| 📊 Analytics Platform w/ Document Store | `examples/analytics-platform-with-document-store` | Data Lake, DocumentDB, MSK, Glue, Bastion | ~$780 | Mixed structured + semi-structured analytics |
| 🔄 Data Processing Pipeline | `examples/data-processing-pipeline` | Data Lake, Glue Jobs/Workflow, KMS | ~$180 | Scheduled ETL / batch processing |
| 🧩 Multi-Account Data Platform (Simulated) | `examples/multi-account-data-platform` | Central KMS, Transit GW, Data Lake, Glue, Bastion (aliased providers) | ~$210 | Learning multi-account patterns |

*These cost estimates were calculated at the time each example was authored using on-demand pricing in a common AWS region (e.g., us-east-1) and assume minimal throughput. Actual costs vary by region, usage, data transfer, storage growth, and instance sizing. Always run your own cost validation (AWS Pricing Calculator / Infracost) before production use.
